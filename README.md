This is not really of a calibre for publishing on crates.io, it's just something I've used
within other personal projects. You may use it, and you may contribute to it, but don't
expect me to spend much time on this.

This is a rust crate for storing files without duplication.

It may make unwarranted assumptions. Probably needs tweaking before it is generally useful.
